# Pong
The Pong game coded in Python Turtle

The ball moves around the screen, bouncing off the top and bottom walls. The goal is to not let the ball hit the right or left side depending on which paddle you are controlling.
The right paddle moves up when the keyboard up arrow is clicked, and down with the down arrow key.
The left paddle moves up with the w key and down with the s key.
